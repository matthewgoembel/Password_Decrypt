Consider FBI has some suspects of cyber criminals and it would like to break into their online accounts to gather more
evidence. Naturally, the accounts are password protected.

The goal is to help FBI gain access to suspects’ online accounts. Desgin a “brute-force” algorithm that recursively 
enumerates all possible strings. For simplicity, consider only lower-case letters and strings up to a certain
maximum length. Crypto contains the encrypt(String) method that encrypts a string, Decrpyt contains the main method.

Input: The command-line argument for HW2.java is the name of the input file, which has:
  1. the maximum length of a password on the first line
  2. encrypted password on each following line
     
Output: Each line contains the password before encryption
