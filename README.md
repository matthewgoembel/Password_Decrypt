# Password_Decrypt
The Java program presented is designed to assist law enforcement, specifically the FBI, in decrypting passwords obtained during investigations. The program takes encrypted passwords as input from a file, encrypts possible combinations using a brute-force algorithm, and compares them to the provided encrypted passwords until a match is found. Two approaches are implemented: one uses recursion (decrypt method), and the other uses stacks (decryptStack method). The Crypto class handles the encryption, which employs a randomization process. The decrypt method systematically generates all possible password combinations, encrypts them, and checks for matches. Meanwhile, the decryptStack method uses stacks to explore potential passwords until a match is identified efficiently. This program demonstrates a strong understanding of cryptographic algorithms, recursion, and stack-based solutions, showcasing the author's proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and programming techniques.
